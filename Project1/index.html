      <p class="description-text">
      On 7 October 2023, around 70 Hamas terrorists attacked Kfar Aza, a kibbutz about 3 kilometers (1.9 mi) from the border with the Gaza Strip, massacring residents and abducting several hostages.
      The attack is notable for claims of brutality in the form of beheadings,dismemberment,rape and victims having been burned alive.
     <br><br> Around 6:30 am terrorists entered Kfar Aza. The IDF arrived approximately two hours later but were vastly outnumbered. Another wave of terrorists entered in the evening around 20:00 pm of October 7th. The battle to clear all terrorists and evacuate civilians from Kfar Aza took over 24 hours, extending into well into October 8th.
      </p>
      <P class="description-text">
        During the attack and its aftermath, residents and their families used various communication channels, including WhatsApp groups, to share critical information, seek help, and provide updates on their situations. These messages, spread across multiple group chats, paint a harrowing picture of the events as they unfolded, offering real-time accounts of the terror and chaos experienced by those affected.
