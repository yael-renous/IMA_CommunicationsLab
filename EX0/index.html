    <h1>Asteroids</h1>
    <p>This project is a visual representation of near-Earth asteroids, using real-time data from NASA's NeoWs Asteroid API. The visualization displays asteroids as circles that move closer to the center based on their miss distance from Earth. The size of each circle reflects the asteroid's velocity, with faster-moving asteroids appearing larger. Concentric rings indicate varying distances from Earth, providing a clear depiction of how close these celestial objects are on any given day. </p>
