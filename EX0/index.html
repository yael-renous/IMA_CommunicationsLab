    <p>A visual representation of near-Earth asteroids, using real-time data from NASA's NeoWs Asteroid API. The visualization displays asteroids as circles, with their name and discovery date shown in the center. The circles move closer to the center based on their miss distance from Earth and grown in size of at a speed reflective of the asteroid's velocity. Concentric rings patterns are made up of the numeral data of the asteroids distance an velocity. </p>
